//write blocks and states directly to NBT? Less memory usage.
//re-organize code. Create GUI functions and use those to save space in the object structure

Add 4 buttons, and an import switch

Export to NBT | Export to Schematic
Export to World | Export to JMC2OBJ

Export to .obj
- Get blocks
- Create vertex for blocks based on json model
- Create sprite sheet and write texture coords
	(create face of cube, create texture coords for face, make it a face, repeat)
	
" from: Start point of a cube according to the scheme [x, y, z]. Values must be between -16 and 32.
 to: Stop point of a cube according to the scheme [x, y, z]. Values must be between -16 and 32. "
 
Divide cube into north/east/west/south planes. can use remove doubles later iin blender.

example: 
	x1 y1 z1 = corner 1
	x2 y2 z2 = corner 2
	x1-y1-z1  x1-y2-z1  x2-y2-z1  x2-y1-z1
	same z, but a plane on x and y.
	
	order the y coordinates by height
	and the x/z coordinates by x<x1
	
	up = x1-y2-z1 x2-y2-z1 x2-y2-z2 x1-y2-z1
	
	switch(faces) { "up" "down" "etc" }
